The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a nationwide rural road development initiative by the Government of India. Monitoring project progress, expenditure efficiency, and completion risk is critical for effective infrastructure planning.

This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning techniques on PMGSY data to analyze road completion performance, classify project status, identify key influencing factors, and group projects based on risk patterns. The project also includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an interactive visualization dashboard built using Python.
